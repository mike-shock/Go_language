usage: go tool [-n] command [args...]

Tool runs the go tool command identified by the arguments.

Go ships with a number of builtin tools, and additional tools
may be defined in the go.mod of the current module.

With no arguments it prints the list of known tools.

The -n flag causes tool to print the command that would be executed but not execute it.

The -modfile=file.mod build flag causes tool to use an alternate file
instead of the go.mod in the module root directory.

Tool also provides the -C, -overlay, and -modcacherw build flags.

For more about build flags, see 'go help build'.

For more about each builtin tool command, see 'go doc cmd/<command>'.
